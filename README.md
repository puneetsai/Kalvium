Here are some key insights which I have derived from the 2024 Loksabha Elections data.
In the ipynb file, I have used pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for the data analysis and visualizations to extract some key insights.
And in the pbix file, I have created some meaningful Power BI reports by first transforming data, loading and then creating major visualizations.


In the provided Jupyter Notebook and Power BI file, I performed an in-depth analysis of the 2024 Loksabha Elections data using pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. 
The Python scripts efficiently extract and present key election metrics, while the Power BI reports offer a comprehensive visual overview after data transformation and loading. 
These tools together provide a robust framework for understanding and interpreting the election results.
The combination of detailed data analysis in Python and dynamic, interactive visualizations in Power BI ensures accessible examination of the election data.
